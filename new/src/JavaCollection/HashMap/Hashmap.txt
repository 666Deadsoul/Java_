Similar to arraylist and linkedlist, a hashmap also stores multiple elements together. 
However, each element of a hashmap is a key/value pair.

keys - unique identifiers that are associated with each value on a map
values - actual data that can be accessed using keys

import java.util.HashMap;
HashMap<Integer, String> students = new HashMap<>();
