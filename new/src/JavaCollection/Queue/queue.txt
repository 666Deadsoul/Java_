Think of it as a ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.
That is why the queue is also known as First in First out. data structure.

In queue data structure elements are:
- added from the back (rear)
- removed from the front

As mentioned earlier, LinkedList class in Java implements Deque interface. Hence, LinkedList can provide functionality deque data structures.

To use LinkedList as a dequeue, we use the following methods:
addFirst() - adds an element at the beginning of the deque
addLast() - adds an element at the end of the deque
removeFirst() - removes the first element of the deque
removeLast() - removes the last element of the deque
