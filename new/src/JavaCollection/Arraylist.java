// The ArrayList class allows us to create resizable arrays, 
// which can automatically adjust their capacity when we add or remove elements from them.
// An arraylist is also known as a dynamic array.
//This is because we cannot create an ArrayList of primitive data types such as int, double, char, etc. but can write Integer, Double, Character
//Add, Access, Change, Remove
