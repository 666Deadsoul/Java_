In Java, if we need to perform set-related operations, we use hashset because it provides the functionality of a mathematical set.

For example, if we need to store unique elements, it's better to use a hashset because, 
unlike arraylist and linkedlist, elements in a hashset cannot have duplicate values.

import java.util.HashSet;
HashSet<String> animals = new HashSet<>();
