The Java collections framework provides static methods that provide the functionality of different types of algorithms.

sort() - sorts the elements in a collection
shuffle() - shuffles the elements to destroy any kind of order
binarySearch() - searches for the specified element
min() / max() - finds the minimum and maximum element

The sort() method is a static method, so we don't have to create an object to access it, we can simply use it using the class name, Collections.sort().
The binarySearch() method returns the position of an element in integer form. Hence, we have stored the result in the integer type position variable.

Also, for binarySearch() to work, the arraylist should be sorted.
